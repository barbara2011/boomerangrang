The source of the idea for Boomerangrang is a 1974 video by Richard Serra, with Nancy Holt.  In 1974 Richard Serra recorded Nancy Holt. Serra's video documents Holt speaking... as if to herself; there is no indication of anyone else in the room. In the situation of being recorded, Holt's words are audible to herself mainly through the headphones she is wearing.  The cadence of Holt's voice is shaped, however, not by a real-time mediation of her voice. This is because what she is hearing through her headphones is her voice slightly delayed, less than a second.  That 1974 video, titled "Boomerang" is archived at Video Data Bank (VDB) in Chicago. The VDB description is admirably succinct: "This is a tape which analyzes its own discourse and processes as it is being formulated.  The language of 'Boomerang', and the relation between the description and what is being described, is not arbitrary.  Language and image are being formed and revealed as they are organized."
